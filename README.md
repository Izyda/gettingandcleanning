##About the program
This is repository for getting and cleaning course of coursera.org

Program run_analisys.R is the solution for the problem from Project Assigment. 
This program works on data from research about the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

This program:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

You can find the solution in file end.txt.
